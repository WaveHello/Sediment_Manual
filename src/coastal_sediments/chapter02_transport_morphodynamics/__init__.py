Chapter 2: Sediment Transport and Morphodynamics

This module implements equations from Chapter 2 of ASCE Manual 110.
The chapter is organized into functional groups based on physical processes.

Main topics covered:
- Fluid mechanics and hydraulics for sediment transport
- Sediment properties and characterization
- Threshold conditions for sediment movement
- Bed load transport calculations
- Suspended load transport
- Bed forms and flow resistance
